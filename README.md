# The Next Web

![screenshot](./TNW.jpg)

This project required that we replicate the new web website's home page considering how the page changes with as the device screen size increases or decreases.

## How it was Implemented

We started the project by first designing the mobile view of the home page using a break point of 768px and then continued to the break-point of 1024px that includes the tablet view and other screens larger than 1024px for the desktop view.
